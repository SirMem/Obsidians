Sarcasm andjazzhave something surprisingly in common:You know them when you hear them.Sarcasm ismostly understood through tone of voice,which is used to portray the opposite of the literal words.For example,when someone says,"Well,that's exactly what I need right now,"their tone can tell you it's not what they needat all.

Most frequently,sarcasm highlights an irritation or is,quite simply,mean

If you want to be happier and improve your relationships,cut out sarcasm.Why?Because sarcasm11sactually hostility disguised as humor.

Despite smiling outwardly,many people who receive sarcastic comments feel put down and often think thesarcastic person is rude,or contemptible.Indeed,it's not surprising that the origin of the word sarcasm derivesfrom the Greek word"sarkazein"which literally means "to tear or strip the flesh off."Hence,it's no wonder thatsarcasm is often preceded by the word"cutting"and that it hurts.

What's more,since actions strongly determine thoughts and feelings,when a person consistently actssarcastically it may only serve to heighten their underlying hostility and insecurity.After all,when you comeright down to it,sarcasm can be used as a subtle form of bullying-and most bullies are angry,insecure,orcowardly.

Alternatively,when a person stops voicing negative comments,especially sarcastic ones,they may soonstart to feel happier and more self-confident.Also,other people in their life benefit even more because they nolonger have to hear the emotionally hurtful language of sarcasm.
Now,I'm not saying all sarcasm is bad.Itmay just be betterused sparingly-like a potent spice in cooking.

Too much of the spice,and the dish will be overwhelmed by it.Similarly,an occasional dash of sarcastic wit canspice up a chat and add an element ofhumor to it.But a big or steady serving of sarcasm will overwhelm theemotional flavor ofany conversation and can taste very bitter to its recipient.

So,tone down the sarcasm and work on clever wit instead,which is usually without any hostility and thusmore appreciated by those you're communicating with.In essence,sarcasm is easy while true,harmless wit takes talent.

Thus,the main difference between wit and sarcasm is that,as already stated,sarcasm is often hostilitydisguised as humor.It can be intended to hurt and is often bitter and biting.Witty statements are usually inresponse to someone's unhelpful remarks or behaviors,and the intent is to untangle and clarify the issue by emphasizing its absurdities.Sarcastic statements are expressed in a cutting manner;witty remarks are deliveredwith undisguised and harmless humor.
