一般来说，评判中国烹饪有三个基本标唯，即色、香、味，其中味最为重要。色彩不仅指食物的美丽色彩，也指食物的布局和设计。香气是指上桌的菜在吃之前散发出的香味和诱人的味道。味觉不仅与品尝食物本身有关，还与对调味料和质地的欣赏有关

Genernally speaking, there are three fundamantal standards estimating chinese cooking is judged, namely, colour, aroma, and taste, with taste being most important. Colour refers not only to the beautiful colour of the food, but also to the layout and design. Aroma refers to the fragrant and appetising smell of the dishes served on the table before eating. Taste is not only associated with tasting the food itself, but also with the apprecation of sessonings and texture.
