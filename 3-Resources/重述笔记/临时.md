## tailwindcss

### 1. 安装 Tailwind CSS

确保你已经安装好 Vue 3 项目（例如使用 Vue CLI 或 Vite 创建的项目）。

进入项目目录后，运行以下命令安装 Tailwind CSS 和所需的依赖：

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

然后初始化 Tailwind CSS 配置文件：

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

这会生成一个 `tailwind.config.js` 文件。

---

### 2. 配置 Tailwind CSS

编辑 `tailwind.config.js` 文件，添加你的模板文件路径，以便 Tailwind CSS 能够正确地扫描并生成样式：

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html", // 如果使用的是 Vite
    "./src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}", // 扫描 src 文件夹中的 Vue 和 JS/TS 文件
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {}, // 在这里自定义你的主题
  },
  plugins: [], // 可以添加 Tailwind 的插件，例如 forms、typography 等
};
```

---

### 3. 添加 Tailwind 样式到 CSS 文件

在项目中找到入口样式文件（通常是 `src/main.css` 或 `src/assets/style.css`），添加以下 Tailwind 的基础指令：

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

如果文件不存在，可以新建一个 `src/main.css` 文件并添加以上内容。

---

### 4. Tailwind命令生成 最终CSS


```js
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/css_source/input.css -o ./src/dist/styles.css --watch
```

---

### 5. 开始使用 Tailwind CSS

现在你可以在 Vue 组件中使用 Tailwind CSS 的类名。例如：

```vue
<template>
  <div class="flex justify-center items-center min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-blue-600">Hello, Tailwind CSS in Vue 3!</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'App',
};
</script>
```
